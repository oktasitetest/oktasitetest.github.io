# Release 2016.36

### System Log Enhancement

The names of [AppUser properties](/docs/api/resources/apps.html#application-user-properties)
that have changed during an import are included in the system log. <!-- (OKTA-96525) -->

### Does Your Org Have These Changes Yet?

Check the footer of any Admin page in an org to verify the current release for that org. For example,
scroll to the bottom of the Admin <b>Dashboard</b> page to see the version number:

{% img release_notes/version_footer.png alt:"Release Number in Footer" %}
