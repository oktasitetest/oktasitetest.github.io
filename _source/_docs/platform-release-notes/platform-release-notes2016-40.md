### Feature Enhancement: Listing Apps that Share an Application Key Credential

Once you have shared a credential between apps, you can list all the applications that are using
the same application key credential. <!-- OKTA-100925 -->

For more information, see the [Apps API reference](/docs/api/resources/apps.html#list-applications-using-a-key).

### Does Your Org Have These Changes Yet?
