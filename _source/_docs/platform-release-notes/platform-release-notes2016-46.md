# Release 2016.46

## Platform Bug Fixed

* When creating a user via the API, the user was created even though an exception was thrown because a word from the question was in the answer. (OKTA-106668)

## Does Your Org Have This Change Yet?

Check the footer of any Admin page in an org to verify the current release for that org. For example,
scroll to the bottom of the Admin <b>Dashboard</b> page to see the version number:

{% img release_notes/version_footer.png alt:"Release Number in Footer" %}
