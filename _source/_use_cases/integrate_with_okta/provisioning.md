## Provisioning

Single sign-on is just one aspect of federation. First, an account for the user must be created to grant access to your application. In order to “automate” this process, your application should expose APIs to manage the account lifecycle such as user account creation, profile updates, authorization settings (such as groups or roles), account deactivation, etc.

While many ISVs use proprietary APIs, Okta recommends that you implement your API using the [Simple Cloud Identity Management protocol](http://www.simplecloud.info/) (SCIM) which supports all of the key features needed in provisioning.

[Okta’s SCIM Provisioning Developer Program](/standards/SCIM/index.html)
is designed to help you build your SCIM server and integrate provisioning into the Okta Integration Network.
Get started by reviewing the program process, SCIM docs, and applying to the program.
