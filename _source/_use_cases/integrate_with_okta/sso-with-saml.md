## Single Sign-On

Your application needs to support Federated Single Sign-On, a common approach for an application to rely on an external identity provider. For web-based applications, [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) is the standard. For mobile applications, many mobile solution vendors offer proprietary SDKs to provide support. Okta offers [Okta Mobile Connect](/docs/guides/okta_mobile_connect.html) which is based on the SAML protocol.

For details on how to federate your application with SAML and Okta Mobile Connect, go to our [Single Sign-On with Okta](/docs/guides/saml_guidance.html) section for additional guidance.


### Single Sign-On: Building an Integration with Okta

Use the following instructions to support single sign-on for your app in the public-facing Okta Integration Network:

#### 1. Prepare Your Application

Use Okta’s [Single Sign-On with Okta](/docs/guides/saml_guidance.html) guide for best practices on supporting SAML in your app which includes toolkits and testing tools.

#### 2. Integrate Your App

* Sign up for an Okta [developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).
* In your Okta account (make sure you are signed in as an admin), use the [App Wizard](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Using-the-App-Integration-Wizard) to build a Single Sign-on integration with Okta. For the more visually inclined, see our [video](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Adding-Applications-Using-the-Application-Integration-Wizard-AIW) for using the App Wizard.
* When you are ready, navigate to the Feedback tab of the App Wizard:

    1. Select **I'm a software vendor. I'd like to integrate my app with Okta.** if you want your app added to the OIN. Okta won’t contact you until this option is selected.
    2. Click **Submit your app for review.** You are redirected to [the OIN Manager](https://oanmanager.okta.com/).
        {% img oan-manager.png alt:"OIN Manager submission page" %}
    3. In the OIN Manager, click **Start Submission Form,** and enter the requested information in the General Settings tab.
        {% img oan-general.png alt:"General tab for OIN review" %}
    4. In the SAML tab, select On in the **SAML support** button, and enter information requested.
    5. When you've  entered all the information requested on the General Settings and SAML tabs, the **Submit for Review** button is enabled. Click it to submit your app for review.
        {% img submit-for-review.png alt:"Submit for OIN review" %}

Once submitted, you can track the stage of your integration in the OIN Manager.

>Note: Okta doesn't proactively add SWA-only, branded apps to the OIN. If you want a branded app in the OIN that only supports SWA to all customers, submit a request to <developers@okta.com>.
