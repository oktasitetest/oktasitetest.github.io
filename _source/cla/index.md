# Okta Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Okta's open source
projects! We have developed an Individual Contributor License
Agreement (CLA) for developers to sign when submitting code to Okta on
our public repositories through PRs on GitHub (or other methods). This
CLA allows us to merge in code (or build upon suggested code) in our
sample apps and SDKs, giving us the ability to utilize that code in
the course of our business. A CLA is vital to building up public code
repositories that can be used by a business. The use of CLAs is common
in the development of software, especially open source
software. Examples of other entities that use CLAs
are
[The Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt),
the [Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php),
and
[Google](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual?csw=1).


**The CLA is used to protect the rights of you the Contributor, Okta,
and Okta’s users. The CLA does not take away any right, title, or
interest you have in your contribution and only assigns the rights
specified in the CLA to Okta in order to allow Okta and Okta’s users
to use your contribution.**

You can download our CLA here:

After you download the Okta Individual Contributor License Agreement,
please read and sign it, and then email the signed copy to
[CLA@okta.com](mailto:CLA@okta.com).

## Obvious Fixes: Do I have to sign this?

In certain cases described below, a Contributor License Agreement may
not be required if the contribution(s) are minor enough not to be
considered intellectual property protectable by copyright or patent
law (an "Obvious Fix"). This allows you to make contributions to Okta
for Obvious Fixes without signing anything.

### What Is Considered an Obvious Fix?

An obvious fix is any contribution that is not protectable by
intellectual property law. We generally consider Obvious Fixes to be
changes that do not introduce any new functionality or creativity, for
example:

* Spelling or grammar mistakes
* Typos
* Comments clean-up
* White-space or formatting changes
* Logging messages or debug output
* Changes to "metadata" files that do not impact existing external
  dependencies such as the `.gitignore` file
* Build script errors
* Example configuration files
* Project structure changes like renaming a build directory or
  changing a constant
* Re-ordering of objects, variables or methods within a source file
* Moving source files from one directory to another without code changes
* Refactoring a source file into multiple source files or
  consolidating multiple source files a single source file without
  changing functionality

A Contributor License Agreement would be required for the following as
they are not Obvious Fixes:

* Anything that results in a change in functionality
* A new feature
* A translation, or a refactor that changes functionality
* Extensive or creative comments, changes to README files or documentation

### How Do I Submit an Obvious Fix?

If you believe your contribution is an Obvious Fix, please add
"Obvious Fix" to the pull request description. If Okta believes it is
not an Obvious Fix we may request that you
[sign a CLA](/cla/okta_individual_contributor_license_agreement_2016-11.pdf)
before we merge your pull request.
